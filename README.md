3. Now, activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/ Linux:

source .venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

.venv\Scripts\activate

4. With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary dependencies by running this command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Now that your environment is set up, letâ€™s generate your first speech output by running the following command:
